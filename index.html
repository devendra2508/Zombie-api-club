                <p> <b> Are their secondary sale royalties?</b> <br>
                    Yes, royalties are set at 5%. 25% of those
                    royalties go to the Treasury and will be
                    re-invested to sweep the floor as well as
                    funding community decisions of the DAO.</p>

                <p> <b> Do I own the Zombie Ape after purchasing?</b> <br>
                    Yes, of course! Full rights are given to
                    the owner of the wallet address that
                    minted the Zombie Ape.

                    We are glad you asked. Unfortunately with the
                    popularity of Solana there were a few black
                    sheep including some scams going on. We want
                    to be 100% tranparent with you. See Technical
                    Details on how to verify this yourself.</p>
